      <h2>Benefits of eating healthy food on a regular basis--</h2>
      <p>
        A healthy diet is one that helps maintain or improve overall health. A
        healthy diet provides the body with essential nutrition: fluid,
        macronutrients, micronutrients, and adequate calories. A healthy diet
        may contain fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and includes little to
        no processed food and sweetened beverages. The requirements for a
        healthy diet can be met from a variety of plant-based and animal-based
        foods, although a non-animal source of vitamin B12 is needed for those
        following a vegan diet. Various nutrition guides are published by
        medical and governmental institutions to educate individuals on what
        they should be eating to be healthy. Nutrition facts labels are also
        mandatory in some countries to allow consumers to choose between foods
        based on the components relevant to health.
